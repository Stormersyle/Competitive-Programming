Key idea:
-Start with the aisles, and add seats one distance at a time
-To count # of arrangements:
    Equivalent to finding number of ways we can make n numbers (each 0/1/2) sum to x.
    To do this, just iterate through all combinations of (# of 0s, # of 1s, # of 2s), and
    add trinomial coefficients. O(n).

    (My original attempt: DP, which took O(n^2))

General ideas/takeaways:
-When minimizing something: common strategy is:
go from min number to max number, and take as many as possible of each one.

-Be careful when checking time complexity!



(Note: entirely special case of n<2k, t=-1, r=n:
first put down k+1 0s, one at each end and 1 between each pair of aisles.
now, n-k-1 0s, and k-1 possible places to put them; (k-1\choose n-k-1) ways.)
