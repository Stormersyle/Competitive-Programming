Key idea:
-Find strongest possible necessary condition:
for each a_i that needs to increase, the interval to one of the nearest x's has a<=x and b>=x

-This is sufficient: doing the moves in increasing order lets them not interfere!


Implementation:
-Sparse tables for range min/max queries
-Just iterate through and store last index of each number, to find previous index of a fixed
number at each i
