Key idea:

-We need a mark in each row and column (thus need max(m, n) marks)
    If we don't have a mark in a row/col: that row/col will never get a mark

- construction for max(m, n) marks: zigzag along the diagonal across the entire board!
    Proof this works: the diagonals "grow out" one by one


Thus: min marks to start with is max(m, n).
