Key idea:
-Max subsequence = sequence of all suffix maxes!

-Each right shift of max subsequence:
    last term & first pos get cut off; rest of terms shift right, and set of positions stays the same.


General idea:
-In a sequence, lexographically maximum subsequence is the sequence of all suffix maxes!
    Algorithm to find maximum subsequence: each step, go to next instance of current suffix max.
