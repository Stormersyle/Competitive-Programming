Key idea:
-Need enough steps and parity match
-If this is the case: always possible!
    If 4k extra steps: loop
    If 4k+2 extra steps: snake + loop

Implementation: keep the right and down segments from each point.
Note: extra segments are fine!

In general: for problems involving moving on a grid,
Important idea: Parity of coordinate sum changes every move!
                (Can also think of it as a checkerboard coloring)
