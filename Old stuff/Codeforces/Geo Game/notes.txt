Key idea:
-Adding dist^2 = adding sum of coords, (mod 2); so final sum parity depends only on last point
                                                (since first point fixed, everything else added twice)

-So each player: want a certain parity to be last, and reduce the opposite parity each move.

(Overall: parity that appears more wins)
