Key idea:
-View each pair (a_i, b_i) as a segment on the number line, and total diff as sum of lengths!

Solution:
-View each (a_i, b_i) as a segment on the number line, and total diff as sum of lengths
-Swapping only helps for non-intersecting segments
    Increase from swapping = 2*(distance apart)
    Thus, problem reduces to finding the max distance between two (non-intersecting) segments


General ideas:
-When dealing with absolute value: always think about distances!
    very often, absolute value stuff can be better interpreted geometrically/in terms of distances
