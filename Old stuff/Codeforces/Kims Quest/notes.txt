Key idea:
-Only care about terms (mod 2), so treat it as a binary sequence
-DP/recursion: standard prefix DP for each pair of last 2 digits
    Particularly: find (# of valid sequences in each prefix with each pair of last 2 digits (00, 01, 10, 11))
    This makes transitions easy, since last 2 digits tells us previous digit!
