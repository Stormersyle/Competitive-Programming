Key idea: Straightforward subtree DP

If we know min # of moves to fix each of left subtree and right subtree: easy to find how many moves to fix
this overall subtree

General ideas:
Remember, subtree DP!
Subtree DP useful when calculating something for a subtree is easy once we've found it for all the
child subtrees. Do this bottom up, takes O(n)
