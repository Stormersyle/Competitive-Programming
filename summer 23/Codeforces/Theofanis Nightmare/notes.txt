Key idea:
In terms of the sum, starting a new subarray is equivalent to duplicating the current suffix!

(so we just add all positive suffixes, after the first one)

General ideas:
-Look at sums from two dimensions!
Particularly: the sum a_1+2a_2+3a_3+....+ka_k can also be viewed in "row form", as the sum of k rows!
(This is what we did here: look at it as rows)
