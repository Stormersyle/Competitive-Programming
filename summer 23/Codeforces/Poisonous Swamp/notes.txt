Key idea: 2 x n grid with 1 mark per column looks like alternating "bars" on the top/bottom

And for each bar: one frog escapes, rest die


Note: if instead the problem didn't specify that each lilypad must have a frog (and only that
each frog must be on a lilypad), then:

-Key idea: on each bar, optimal to have the leftmost frog hop left if possible, or hop right if not;
           so optimal to greedily save frogs from left to right (for each bar)
Remember greedy!

AND: don't misread the problem (like I did two times)
