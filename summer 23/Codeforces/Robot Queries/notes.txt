Key idea:
-To check if position is reached in "middle part" of sequence:
    equivalent to checking if a different position is in a range of suffix sums!

Rest of solution:
-And to check if reached in first/last part of sequence:
    equivalent to checking if position is in range of prefix sums
To check if a position is in range of prefix/suffix sums: can directly do in O(log n), by keeping a list of
the prefix/suffix sums that equal each pos.


General ideas:
-INTERPRET USING PREFIX/SUFFIX SUMS!
-Easy to check if something's in a range of prefix/suffix sums
