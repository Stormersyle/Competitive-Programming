Key idea:
-Make functional graph, interpret as assigning 0/1 to edges
-For each branched ring:
    Assignments to the branches (trees) are fixed
    Two inversing possibilities for ring assignments; just check one (and if work, take the better one)

General ideas:
-Functional graph consists of branched rings! (BRANCHED rings, NOT spiked rings)
-Try graph interpretations!
